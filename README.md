# MVP: Quote-o-meter - Andi NowÃ« 

The idea of this project is to build a website to store the best quotes and jokes from role-playing games sessions, like D\&D, Vampire, Cyberpunk, etc, in an RPG/8-bit styled app.

## Installation

- Install Node.js for the back end and front end:

```bash
npm install
```
- Install FontAwesome for React for the icon: [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react)

- This is the library used for the Css: [RonenNess-RPGUI](https://github.com/RonenNess/RPGUI/blob/master/README.md#what-is-it)

- The back end is built using MYSQL and Express.

- The front end is built with React.

- Back end tested with Postman.

- To create an empty database from scratch we will use this command on the mysql console:

```bash
mysql -u root -p mvp < [C:\Insert here the route of the "init-db.sql" file}
```
